1) Prediction: when you click on anything in the table,
an alert will pop up with the value of the cell you clicked
on. QCC: Why use a for loop and addEventListener and not
the onclick property?

Reality: our prediction was accurate.

2) Prediction: the order of results when a click is made 
will be the cell data first, then the row, then the entire 
table. 

Reality: our prediction was accurate.

3) Prediction: when e.stopPropagation() is called, it 
will stop the other 2 alerts from happening (only the first 
alert with the cell data will appear).

Reality: we were correct about the effects of stopPropagation
but wrong about the actual order. We did not notice the true 
as the third argument in the addEventListener for the entire table
to call clicky which made it come first and therefore be the only 
one to appear out of the three.

4) Prediction: the event listeners will all bypass the stopPropagation 
when uncommented because the third argument is set to true on all 3. 
The order that the events are listed does matter and will reflect the 
order that they appear in the alert.

Reality: we were wrong about both predictions. stopPropagation still stops 
the second and third alerts from coming through and the order of the 
event listeners does not matter, it will always go table, then row, then cell. 
Does this mean it follows the html tree when the third argument is set to true?
