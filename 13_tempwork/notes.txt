K13: Template for Success
2020-10-16

Used DictReader to convert the file into a dictionary (dic) with 2 keys "jobs" and "percentages".
Inside each key we used DictReader to append the proper items.
Then we combined both lists into tuples and zipped them to their corresponding job:percentage.
We also made a mini list containing the titles of each column.
Then we used random.choices() to pick the random job.
Finally, we funneled all this info into the template using render_template.

We put the file reading inside of the tablified function so the table would remain on refresh.

We found that putting <br> inside a string and subbing it into jinja didn't auto convert it into
html, so we just hardcoded the heading into the template.

For the table, we used a zip (tuple of tuples) to list the contents of the dictionary onto
the table and we iterated through both tuples simultaneously with a for loop.
