2020-29-16

- The Mongo database is a structured way to store and access data
- NoSQL database: not a legacy approach of rows/columns
- NoSQL document database, data is stored in documents, which are stored in collections of documents, which are stored in a database
- Collection: an organized store of documents in MongoDB usually with common fields between documents. There can be many collections per database and many documents per collection.

- Document: a way to organize and store data as a set of field-value pairs.
- Field: a unique identifier for a datapoint. (like a key)
- Value: data related to a given identifier.

- Atlas is the main database which uses MongoDB, and is configured in a replica set, which are several instances of MongoDB and store redundant data.
	- Atlas does more than just database stuff for MongoDB
- Replica Set: a few connected machines that store the same data to ensure that if something happens to one of the machines the data will remain intact. Comes from the word replicate - to copy something.
- Instance: a single machine locally or in the cloud, running a certain software, in our case it is the MongoDB database.
	- By having multiple instances, data is not lost if one machine goes down
- Cluster: group of servers that store your data.
-  Atlas > Cluster > Replica Set > Instances

- In clusters page, top panel does services like charts and realms, and left panel is navigation
- Collections button > data explorer
- Connect button > ip address and user info
- connect button > connect with the mongo shell
- 0.0.0.0 allows ip access from anywhere

- There is an browser IDE in mongoDB for lab assignments, comes with a code editor and terminal
-`mongo` is a command that lists info about the installation
