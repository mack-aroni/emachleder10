- JSON: Javascript Standard Object Notation
- JSON format:
	- start and end with curly braces {}
	-separate key and value with :
	-separate key-value pairs with ,
	-put “” around keys
	-keys aka fields
- Some software will accept if you don’t put “” but not all software does that
- Values may also be documents
- JSON is friendly, readable, and familiar, but it is text based (slow), space-consuming, and supports limited data types.
- BSON: binary JSON, represents JSON in binary to achieve high performance and general purpose.
- BSON has been extended to add more types like dates and binary data.
- MongoDB internally stores in BSON but it can still be thought of and viewed with JSON

- Importing and exporting data: 
- export in BSON because it’s lighter and faster, but viewing with JSON
- “mongoimport” (JSON) --uri “<Atlas Cluster URI>”
			      --dump=<filename>.json
			      (optional) --collection <collection name>
	- Imports data in BSON dump
- “mongoexport” (JSON) --uri “<Atlas Cluster URI>”
                 --collection=<collection name>
                 --out=<filename>.json
- exports data in JSON (the entire thing is one command)
-”mongorestore” (BSON) -- uri “<Atlas Cluster URI>”
   	      --drop dump 
- imports data in BSON dump, removes the existing database in that location to prevent errors
-”mongodump” -- uri “<Atlas Cluster URI>” 
- (BSON): exports data in BSON
- URI = uniform resource identifier, the url when you connect
- srv: secure connection string: username, password, then database
- Exports to the directory you are currently in
- Using mongorestore and mongodump is a good backup strategy

- Ways to interact with data:
- Data explorer: collections button
	- Left menu bar lists databases and their collections
- Namespace - The concatenation of the database name and collection name is called a namespace.
- In query, can list multiple key-value pairs to narrow down search (can be done in shell) (use valid JSON)
	
- Connecting to an unspecified database defaults to test. Admin is the default administrative database.
- “show dbs”: shows list of databases in the cluster
- Local database is another default database for administrative stuff.
- “use <database>” command specifies which db we’re using
- “show collections” lists the commands
- “db.<collection name>.find( <query> )”
	-query includes the curly brackets
	-“db.<collection name>.find( <query> ).count()” tells you how many results you get
-“db.<collection name>.find( <query> ).pretty()” makes each field-value pair appear on a separate line
-using the find command with no query lists the first 20 entries that doesn’t really have an ordering system
- “it” allows you to see more query results, iterates through a cursor
- Cursor: a pointer to a result set of a query
- Pointer: a direct address of the memory location
- Mongo shell is a javascript interpreter
